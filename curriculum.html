             My name is <span class="infoName">Matias Collins</span> , born in Hartford in the early 70's but moved early to Brazil where I spent from primary to some years of university at the UNICAMP, with Food Technology Engineering as major. Ended up finishing the one in Argentina at the UADE around 1996.<br />
            Currently living in Buenos Aires, Argentina but due to profession , traveling abroad quite a lot to Europe and North America.<br />
            Despite my major was related to Engineering two good professors at UNICAMP introduced me to Statistics and Programming, the lenguage studied was TURBO PASCAL, since then my focus started to be in the software instead the food processing...<br />
            Besides my studies, I was always dedicated in my sport life, earlier with less committments focused in various sports, many of them at competition level like Surf, Sailing, Rugby, Swimming and Ski. But after moved to Argentina the focus was left on Rugby and Sailing to end up nowadays only on Sailing with some basic training in Swimming .<br />
            My work despite starting in the food industry (<span class="infoGate">Gate Gourmet - Swiss Airlines </span>catering) ended up inside IBM to fix software due to the 2000 year bug, mainly in mainframes using COBOL.<br />
            Later on my passion was stronger then I dedicated time to sail and try a spot at the 2000 Olympic Games, which we couldn't get into it, but at the end I started to work as executive secretary of the discipline and improved their website, and information management, mostly done at the web. While Working I kept my commitment to sail at a good level and compete in many different events world wide, binding the sport with the work.</span>
